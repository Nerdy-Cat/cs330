    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I learned how to realistically plan projects. Simplifying my piece to include only important details helped with my ability to complete it efficiently.
        
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started with a vision in my head and wrote it down. I then went major object/part by major object in creating the scene. I started simple and worked my way up to the most complex one.
        
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can use this strategy of breaking it down in future designs. If I start with the simple parts, I can use my knowledge gained for the more complex parts.
        
    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
I didn't fully complete the layout until the final milestone. I added more with each step which left me with plenty to test with, without being overwhelming. As I added the final parts of the scene, I had to go back and slightly adjust the ortho view frame.
        
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As I gained familiarity, problem solving wasn't so hard at the end. I was able to make educated guesses to fix my ortho frame sucessfully. I had been mainly using the example as a refrence but the ortho frame in the refrence wouldn't work for my piece. I was able to find a solution on my own.
        
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Since my goal is to become a data scientist, knowledge of CS is vital. I will use this knowledge to help me adapt to new projects and situations.
    
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I took this class while taking applied liner algebra, so there was significant crossover which was very helpful in understanding both.
        
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Since my career goal is in the CS field, I will be using the skills every day. I will especially use the method of milestones and iterating design.
